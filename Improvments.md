- #### WCAG 2.1 compliant 👨‍🦯
- Pages can be navigated using only the keyboard.
- Color-contrast has been rasied to high contrast. 
- Forms now has correct labels for screen readers. 
- Aria tags have been added, ONLY where necessary instead of semantic HTML.

## Moved things 🚛

##### Spinner
- I moved the loading spinner implemented through DaisyUI to it's own component.

## Summary 📚
After the pages contrast was raised together with creating an easily navigated page using the tab and enter keys our site became friendlier and easier to use for everyone. 

This together with an dynamic validation on the length of text which made it much simpler for our users to know when they passed the upper text limit instead of being informed of this once they tried to submit. 

A dynamic search also allowed users to search for the title of the events all while keeping their sorting order. This created simplified the ability to quickly organize and find the wanted events instead of looking through them individually each time. 

This should hopefully create a more enjoyable experience for our users.
